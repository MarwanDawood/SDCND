## Project overview
This section should contain a brief description of the project and what we are trying to achieve. Why is object detection such an important component of self driving car systems?

## Dataset
### Dataset analysis
This section should contain a quantitative and qualitative description of the dataset. It should include images, charts and other visualizations.
- Most of the objects are far.
- There are 2 classes, cars, pedestrians
- Trucks are classified as cars
- There are few/no occlusion ojects
- Low camera resolution
- Most of the car pictures are taken from front or rear side
- No/few images with very bright/sunny light

### Cross validation
This section should detail the cross validation strategy and justify your approach.

### Training
Reference experiment
This section should detail the results of the reference experiment. It should includes training metrics and a detailed explanation of the algorithm's performances.

## Improve on the reference
This section should highlight the different strategies you adopted to improve your model. It should contain relevant figures and details of your findings.
